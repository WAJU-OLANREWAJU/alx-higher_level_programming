we have designed our program around functions ie\
blocks of statements which manipulate data\
This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming\
There is another way of organizing your program\
which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it\
inside something called an object This is called the object\
oriented programming paradigm Most of the time you can use procedural\
programming, but when writing large programs or have a problem\
that is better suited to this method\
you can use object oriented programming techniques""")
